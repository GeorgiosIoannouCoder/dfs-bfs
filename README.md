## About The Project

![Project Name Screen Shot][project-screenshot]

- **Depth First Search - Breadth First Search On A 2D-Grid allows people to traverse and search a particular number in a 2D-Grid.**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) are two techniques of traversing graphs and trees. DFS explores a graph or tree by diving as deeply as possible along a branch before backtracking, making it well-suited for tasks like finding paths and topological sorting. It is implemented using the stack data structure and recursion. Arrays/Lists can be used to implement the stack data structure.**
- **BFS systematically explores all neighbors of a node before moving to their neighbors, making it ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs and efficiently visiting nodes level by level. BFS employs a queue to maintain a first-in-first-out order, allowing them to serve different graph exploration needs.**

## Problem Statement

1. Given the 2D-Grid in the below Figure, start at the black 1 position and reach the goal at the red 15 position. Find the path to the goal using:
   1. Depth First Search (DFS)
   2. Breadth First Search (BFS)

### Key Features

1. **Usually we see Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) on a Tree. However, they can also be used in a graph or grid which is what we do here.**

## Getting Started

**To get a local copy of the Depth First Search - Breadth First Search On A 2D-Grid up and running locally follow these simple example steps:**

### Prerequisites

**NOTE:** How to check if Python is installed and what is its version

```sh
  python --version
```

**NOTE:** How to check if Git is installed and what is its version

```sh
  git -v
```

1. Please make sure you have pyenv installed and use any Python3 version:

   - You can use pyenv to switch between different Python versions:
     - Windows: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTx18uyyHw8](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win)
     - Mac: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31WU0Dhw4sk](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
     - Linux: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Zgo8M9yUtM](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)

2. Please make sure you have git installed

   - Windows: [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
   - Mac: [https://git-scm.com/download/mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
   - Linux: [https://git-scm.com/download/linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)

#### SetUp

1. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone/run/save the application

   ```sh
   cd your_selected_directory
   ```

2. Clone this repository

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/GeorgiosIoannouCoder/dfs-bfs.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the dfs-bfs git repository

   ```sh
   cd dfs-bfs
   ```

4. Use any Python3 version in the cloned repository folder:

   ```sh
   pyenv local 3.xx.xx
   ```

5. Create virtual environment in the cloned repository folder

   ```sh
   python -m venv .dfs-bfs-venv
   ```

6. Activate the virtual environment (Windows OR Mac/Linux):
   1. Windows

   ```sh
   .\.dfs-bfs-venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   2. Mac/Linux

   ```sh
   source .dfs-bfs/bin/activate
   ```

7. Install ipykernel:

   ```sh
   pip install ipykernel
   ```

8. Install Jupyter Notebook:

   ```sh
   pip install jupyter notebook
   ```

9.  Add the kernel of the virtual environment in the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```sh
   ipython kernel install --user --name=.dfs-bfs-venv
   ```

10. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

11. Select the .dfs-bfs-venv kernel to run the Jupyter Notebook.

## Usage

1. Define/Input a grid, starting cell, goal cell, and traversal directions, use Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) to find the goal cell in the 2D-Grid.
2. You can use the two notebooks above for both [Depth First Search (DFS)](https://github.com/GeorgiosIoannouCoder/dfs-bfs/blob/main/Ioannou_Georgios_dfs.ipynb) and [Breadth First Search (BFS)](https://github.com/GeorgiosIoannouCoder/dfs-bfs/blob/main/Ioannou_Georgios_bfs.ipynb)
3. The two notebooks above were coded having in mind the problem statement mentioned in the introduction.

## Report

1. You can find the report for this project [here](https://github.com/GeorgiosIoannouCoder/dfs-bfs/blob/main/Ioannou_Georgios_Report_HW_2-1.pdf) where it shows step by step how Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS) work to find the goal cell.
